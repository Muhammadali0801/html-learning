"#HTML Basic Syntax"
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) uses a simple syntax to structure and display content on the web. HTML documents consist of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;tagname&gt;). These elements help organize the content and tell the browser how to display it.

Explanation of Key Components:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: Declares the document type and version of HTML.

&lt;html&gt;: The root element that contains all other elements on the page.

&lt;head&gt;: Contains metadata, such as the character set and document title, which is not displayed on the webpage itself.

&lt;title&gt;: Defines the title of the page that appears in the browser tab.

&lt;body&gt;: Contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, etc.

&lt;h1&gt;: Represents a top-level heading, used to indicate the main heading of the document.

&lt;p&gt;: Represents a paragraph of text.


By using these basic elements, you can start building and structuring web pages. Additional HTML tags allow you to incorporate media, links, lists, and much more, making it a versatile tool for web development.

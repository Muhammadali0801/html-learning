# HTML `<abbr>` and `<acronym>` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage of the `<abbr>` (abbreviation) and `<acronym>` tags in HTML, both of which are used to represent shortened forms of words or phrases.

### 1. `<abbr>` Tag (Abbreviation)

The `<abbr>` tag is used to represent an abbreviation or shortened form of a word or phrase. When using this tag, you can include the full term in the `title` attribute so that when users hover over the abbreviation, they can see the expanded version. This is helpful for acronyms, technical terms, or names that may not be familiar to all readers.

### 2. `<acronym>` Tag (Acronym) [Deprecated]
The `<acronym>` tag was originally used for marking up acronyms, similar to the `<abbr>` tag. However, it has been deprecated in HTML5, meaning it is no longer recommended for use. The `<abbr>` tag should now be used for both abbreviations and acronyms.

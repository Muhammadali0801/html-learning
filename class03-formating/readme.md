# HTML Bold, Italic, Subscript, and Superscript Tags

This document explains the usage of the `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<sub>`, and `<sup>` tags in HTML to create bold, italic, subscript, and superscript text. These tags are essential for emphasizing and formatting content on a webpage.

### 1. `<b>` Tag (Bold Text)

The `<b>` tag is used to make text appear bold. It has no semantic meaning and is purely used for visual styling.


### 2. `<strong>` Tag (Important Bold Text)
The `<strong>` tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text is of strong importance. By default, it is rendered as bold, but it also adds semantic meaning for search engines and screen readers.

### 3. `<i>` Tag (Italic Text)
The `<i>` tag is used to italicize text without adding any semantic meaning.

### 4. `<em>` Tag (Emphasized Italic Text)
The `<em>` tag is used to emphasize text, typically rendered in italics, and provides semantic meaning to the enclosed content.

### 5. `<sub>` Tag (Subscript Text)
The `<sub>` tag is used to display subscript text, which is text that appears smaller and is positioned slightly lower than the baseline of surrounding text.

### 6. `<sup>` Tag (Superscript Text)
The `<sup>` tag is used to display superscript text, which is text that appears smaller and is positioned slightly above the baseline of surrounding text.


## Key Differences:
`<b>`: Makes text bold for visual emphasis, no semantic meaning.
`<strong>`: Makes text bold and conveys importance or urgency.
`<i>`: Italicizes text for styling purposes, no semantic meaning.
`<em>`: Italicizes text and indicates emphasis, recognized by search engines and accessibility tools.
`<sub>`: Displays subscript text, commonly used in chemical formulas and math.
`<sup>`: Displays superscript text, often used in math equations or citations.

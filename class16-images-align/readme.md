# HTML Align Attribute for Images

This document explains how to use the deprecated `align` attribute in HTML to align images both horizontally and vertically.

---

### 1. Adding Images

In HTML, images are added using the `<img>` tag, and you can use the `align` attribute to control the alignment of the image. The `align` attribute can take values such as `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, and `middle`.

### 2. Horizontal Alignment
To align an image horizontally using the align attribute, you can use the following values:

left: Aligns the image to the left of the text.
right: Aligns the image to the right of the text.
center: Centers the image in the middle (though this usage is more common with CSS).

### 3. Vertical Alignment
To align images vertically, you typically place them in separate lines, but you can also use the align attribute. The most common values used for vertical alignment are top, middle, and bottom.

# Important Note
The align attribute is deprecated in HTML5. It is recommended to use CSS for controlling the layout and alignment of images. Using CSS provides more flexibility and is more widely supported across modern browsers.

# HTML Nested Lists

This document explains the concept of **nested lists** in HTML, which are lists within lists. You can nest ordered lists (`<ol>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and description lists (`<dl>`) inside each other to create complex, multi-level lists.

### 1. Mixed Nested Lists
You can mix ordered and unordered lists in a single nested structure. This is useful when you want to combine different types of information.

## Key Points:
Nesting Lists: You can nest one list inside another by placing a new list inside an `<li>` element.

Structure: Nested lists help create clear, hierarchical structures in your content, making it more organized and easier to read.

Use Cases: Nested lists are commonly used in menus, task breakdowns, categories with subcategories, and multi-step processes.

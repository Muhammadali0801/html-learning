# HTML `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<dl>` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage and purpose of the `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<dl>` tags in HTML, which are used to create different types of lists: ordered, unordered, and description lists.

---

### 1. `<ol>` Tag (Ordered List)

The `<ol>` tag is used to create an ordered list, where each list item is numbered or lettered. This is useful for lists where the sequence or order of items matters. Each item in the list is wrapped inside an `<li>` (list item) tag.


### 2. `<ul>` Tag (Unordered List)
The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list, where each item is displayed with a bullet point. This type of list is ideal when the order of the items is not important. Like the `<ol>` tag, each item is enclosed in an `<li>` tag.

### 3. `<dl>` Tag (Description List)
The `<dl>` tag is used to create a description list, which consists of terms and their corresponding descriptions. This is often used for glossaries or to present key-value pairs. Inside the `<dl>` tag, the terms are wrapped in `<dt>` (definition term) tags, and the descriptions are wrapped in `<dd>` (definition description) tags.

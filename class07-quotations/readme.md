# HTML `<q>` and `<blockquote>` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage of the `<q>` (inline quote) and `<blockquote>` (block quote) tags in HTML, both of which are used to display quotations on a webpage.

### 1. `<q>` Tag (Inline Quote)

The `<q>` tag is used to enclose short inline quotations. Browsers usually add quotation marks around the content inside a `<q>` tag automatically. It is typically used when quoting small pieces of text within a paragraph.

### 2. `<blockquote>` Tag (Block Quote)
The `<blockquote>` tag is used to define longer, block-level quotations. This tag is used for quoting large sections of text, and it is typically displayed as an indented block of text. The browser does not automatically add quotation marks around `<blockquote>` content.


## Key Differences:
`<q>` (Inline Quotes): Used for short quotes within a paragraph. Quotation marks are automatically added by the browser.

`<blockquote>` (Block Quotes): Used for longer quotes or passages, displayed as a block of text, often with indentation, but without automatically added quotation marks.

Accessibility: Both tags help browsers and assistive technologies recognize and display quotations properly. They also improve semantic meaning, which benefits search engines and screen readers.

# HTML Semantic Markup

This document explains what semantic markup is, why it is important in web development, and provides an overview of the commonly used semantic HTML tags.

### What is Semantic Markup?

Semantic markup refers to HTML elements that not only describe how content should be displayed but also provide meaning (semantics) to the content. These tags clearly describe the purpose and structure of the content, making it easier for browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to interpret the content accurately.

### Why Use Semantic Markup?

1. **Improved Accessibility**: Semantic elements make it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the structure of a page, enhancing accessibility for users with disabilities.
  
2. **Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the content and its importance, improving the pageâ€™s ranking in search results.

3. **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability**: Using semantic elements makes your HTML code more readable for developers by providing clear meaning and structure, making it easier to maintain and update.

4. **Consistent Styling**: Semantic tags often come with default browser styling, which can simplify layout and design consistency.

### Common Semantic HTML Tags

#### 1. `<header>`: Defines a header section for a document or section.

#### 2. `<nav>`: Defines a section that contains navigation links.

#### 3. `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document. There should only be one `<main>` element per page.

#### 4. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed, such as a blog post or news article.

#### 5. `<section>`: Defines a section of content that is thematically grouped.

#### 6. `<aside>`: Defines content that is related but separate from the main content, often used for sidebars or callout boxes.

#### 7. `<footer>`: Represents the footer section of a document or section, typically containing metadata or links.

#### 8. `<figure>`: Represents self-contained content, such as images or diagrams, that is often accompanied by a caption.

#### 9. `<figcaption>`: Defines a caption for the content within the `<figure>` tag.

#### 10. `<mark>`: Highlights a portion of text to indicate relevance or importance.

## Key Points:
Semantic markup provides meaning to your HTML, making it easier for search engines, browsers, and accessibility tools to understand your content.
Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` help define the structure of a webpage, improving readability, SEO, and accessibility.
Using semantic tags is a best practice in modern web development, ensuring that your code is both functional and meaningful.

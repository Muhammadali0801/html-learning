# HTML Tag Descriptions

This document explains three fundamental HTML tags: &lt;title&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, and &lt;p&gt;. These tags are essential for structuring content and defining the purpose of a web page.

##  &lt;title&gt; Tag
The &lt;title&gt; tag is used to define the title of the HTML document. This title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and it's important for both usability and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

## &lt;body&gt; Tag
The &lt;body&gt; tag contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, and other elements that are rendered by the browser.

### Key Difference:

&lt;title&gt;: Defines the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab and search engine results. It is not visible on the actual webpage.

&lt;body&gt;: Contains all the visible content that is displayed on the webpage and is rendered in the browser window.

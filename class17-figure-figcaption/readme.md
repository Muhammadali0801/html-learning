# HTML `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` Tags

This document explains the use of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags in HTML, which are used to group images and provide descriptive captions for them. These tags are part of semantic HTML and help in better structuring of web content.

---

### 1. The `<figure>` Tag

The `<figure>` tag is used to group self-contained content, like an image, a diagram, or other media. The content inside the `<figure>` tag is usually independent of the main flow of the document, meaning it could be moved elsewhere in the document without affecting the document's meaning.

### 2. The `<figcaption>` Tag

The `<figcaption>` tag is used inside the `<figure>` tag to provide a caption for the content within the `<figure>`. This caption helps in describing the image or media content, making it more accessible to users and screen readers.

# HTML `<del>`, `<ins>`, and `<s>` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage and purpose of the `<del>`, `<ins>`, and `<s>` tags in HTML, which are used to represent changes to a document and to display strikethrough text.

---

### 1. `<del>` Tag (Deleted Text)

The `<del>` tag is used to indicate text that has been deleted from a document. The content enclosed within the `<del>` tag is typically displayed with a strikethrough by default in most browsers. It is useful for tracking edits or showing that certain content has been removed.



### 2. `<ins>` Tag (Inserted Text)
The `<ins>` tag is used to represent text that has been inserted or added to a document. Content within the `<ins>` tag is typically displayed with an underline by default in most browsers. This is useful for highlighting new or updated content, especially when working with document revisions or tracking changes.


### 3. `<s>` Tag (Strikethrough Text)
The `<s>` tag is used to represent text that is no longer accurate, relevant, or correct, but is not necessarily deleted. Content inside the `<s>` tag is displayed with a strikethrough. Unlike the `<del>` tag, the `<s>` tag is more often used for stylistic purposes rather than to mark changes in a document's history.

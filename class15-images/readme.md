# HTML Images and Image Placement

This document covers how to effectively use images in HTML, including image placement, alignment, and the use of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.

---

### 1. Adding Images

In HTML, images are added using the `<img>` (image) tag. This tag is self-closing and requires the `src` (source) attribute to specify the image file's location, as well as the `alt` attribute for alternative text, which describes the image for screen readers and when the image cannot be displayed.

### 2. Image Placement
Images can be placed within a web page by positioning the `<img>` tag in the desired location in the HTML code. Images can be displayed inline with text or as block-level elements, depending on the layout requirements.

# HTML `<cite>` and `<dfn>` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage and purpose of the `<cite>` and `<dfn>` tags in HTML, which are used to provide references for citations and define terms, respectively.

---

### 1. `<cite>` Tag (Citation)

The `<cite>` tag is used to reference the title of a creative work, such as a book, website, research paper, movie, song, or artwork. It typically represents the source or citation for content, making it clear where the information is coming from. Text enclosed in the `<cite>` tag is usually italicized by default in most browsers.

### 2. `<dfn>` Tag (Definition)
The `<dfn>` tag is used to indicate that the word or phrase enclosed within it is a term being defined. This tag is useful when you need to highlight the first occurrence of a term and provide a definition for it. Like `<cite>`, content inside `<dfn>` is often italicized by browsers, although the styling can be customized with CSS.

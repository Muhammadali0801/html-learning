## Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages and web applications. It structures content on the web by using a series of elements that define different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is a cornerstone technology for building websites, providing the essential framework that allows browsers to interpret and display the content of a web page.

With HTML, you can create a range of layouts and add interactivity when combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for behavior, forming the basis of modern web development.

# HTML `<br />` and `<hr />` Tag Descriptions

This document explains the usage of two important HTML tags: `<br />` (line break) and `<hr />` (horizontal rule). These tags are used for formatting content and controlling the layout of text on a webpage.

### 1. `<br />` Tag (Line Break)

The `<br />` tag is used to insert a line break within text, moving the content to the next line without starting a new paragraph. It is an empty tag, meaning it does not have a closing tag.

### 2. `<hr />` Tag (Horizontal Rule)
The `<hr />` tag is used to insert a horizontal line (rule) across the width of the webpage. It is also an empty tag and is commonly used to visually separate sections of content.

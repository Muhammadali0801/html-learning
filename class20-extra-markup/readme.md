# Extra HTML Markups

This document explains some additional HTML elements and concepts that are commonly used for structuring and styling web pages.

---

### 1. Class Attribute

The `class` attribute allows you to assign a specific CSS class to HTML elements. Classes are primarily used for styling and grouping elements for JavaScript manipulation.

### 2. Div Elements
The `<div>` element is a block-level container that is used to group other HTML elements. It doesnâ€™t affect the content directly but is used for organizing layout and styling with CSS.

### 3. Div vs. Span
`<div>`: A block-level element, meaning it occupies the full width available and starts on a new line.
`<span>`: An inline element, meaning it takes up only as much width as necessary and does not force line breaks.

### 4. Escape Characters
Escape characters are used to display reserved characters in HTML, such as <, >, and &, which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML tags or special symbols.

Common Escape Characters:
`&lt;`: Displays <
`&gt;`: Displays >
`&amp;`: Displays &

### 5. iFrame
An `<iframe>` (inline frame) is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. It allows you to display external content, such as a webpage, video, or map.

### 6. Comments in Code
Comments are used to leave notes in the HTML code that are not visible in the browser. They are useful for developers to explain sections of the code or for debugging purposes.
